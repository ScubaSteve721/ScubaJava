# Java Restaurant Bill Generator

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

For an assignment in my high school computer programming class, I followed a [tutorial from Alex Lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8vlEyYTPOE) to create a multiple choice quiz Java program. The program will ask the user 3 questions, get input from the user, and return their quiz score out of 3.
