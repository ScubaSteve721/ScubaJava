# Java Palindrome Program

*Programming Language*: JAVA

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

For an assignment in my high school computer programming class, I followed a [tutorial from Alex Lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoRYeB7Os3M) to create a Java program that checks if the user's input is a palindrome or not, disregarding spaces.
